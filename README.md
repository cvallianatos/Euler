# 4 science-backed reasons people with hobbies are more successful

## 1. Better work performance

 Having a hobby outside of work could help you perform better 9-5. A study of 400 employees published in the [Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joop.12064/abstract;jsessionid=ED65EAAD5EA41F936DDF0E0252D06418.f02t02) finds marked differences between those who engage in creative hobbies and those who do not.

 Having a creative hobby is associated with positive work-related traits, like creativity on projects and a better attitude on the job.

 Other [research](http://search.proquest.com/openview/5d9ea365c771fc82adf4e181de38a6ae/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1816610) shows that employees with hobbies are more satisfied with their jobs and have a lower likelihood of burning out.  


## 2. Reduced stress

 Engaging in a mentally stimulating hobby reduces stress, according to research by Matthew Zawadzki, a health psychologist at the University of California, Merced.

Zawadzki's [study](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12160-015-9694-3?sa_campaign=email/event/articleAuthor/onlineFirst) shows that leisure activity can provide immediate stress relief, which has been shown to have [numerous](http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30863901/MBSRMAJPR2004.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&Expires=1479739852&Signature=/1ZXwow3goOVXsKQQxu4f3yXy/I=&response-content-disposition=inline;%20filename=Mindfulness-based_stress_reduction_and_h.pdf) health and psychological benefits, like improved focus, happiness, and a longer life.

 Another study comes to a similar conclusion. Research published in the [National Library of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3962100/) shows that regular leisure activities helps a person manage negative feelings like stress.

## 3. Improved physical health

 Your hobby doesn't have to be physically demanding to correlate with better health.

 A study conducted by several psychologists of about 1,400 people found that people who said they engaged in [enjoyable leisure activities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2863117/) had lower blood pressure, total cortisol, waist circumference, and body mass index.

 In other words, even low-movement hobbies like knitting, crafting, and guitar are correlated with better health.  


## 4. Improved mood

 The benefits of engaging in a hobby extend to hours, even days later. Zawadzki's [study](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12160-015-9694-3?sa_campaign=email/event/articleAuthor/onlineFirst) finds that people with hobbies continue to be happier and to experience lower levels of depression and negative feelings after practice ends.

 "We're still talking about the short term, but there was a definite carryover effect later in the day," he [says](http://panorama.ucmerced.edu/news/study-benefits-leisure-go-beyond-moment) in a university publication. "If we start thinking about that beneficial carryover effect day after day, year after year, it starts to make sense how leisure can help improve health."

 A separate study published in the [The Society of Behavioral Medicine](http://www.ucmerced.edu/sites/ucmerced.edu/files/documents/zawadzki-paper-2015.pdf) finds that that when people engage in a hobby, they show a lower heart rate, reduced stress, and more positive feelings.

 Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi says that being completely absorbed in an activity, what he describes as "flow," is the secret of happiness.

 "When we are involved in \[creativity\], we feel that we are living more fully than during the rest of life," Csikszentmihalyi said during a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow) in 2004. He cites years of research to back up his claim.

 So while knitting, painting, or taking up a new instrument might at first seem like an inefficient use of time, it's actually an investment in your overall well being, science shows.

And if Warren Buffett can make time to play the ukulele, you can too.
